## About

This application develops a lightsaber with only css and pure html.  This lightsaber changes size according to the responsiveness of the page. So the bigger the page, the bigger the lightsaber will be and the smaller the page, the smaller the saber will get until it tends to 0. Special effects have been added to every move made on the page. So when you enlarge the page, a sound effect is generated.

## How to run

To run this application, just run the index.html file in a supported browser.
